# Portfolio

This is my old portfolio static website. I have redesigned my portfolio in a more maintainable and scalable way using React and MUI. This is now viewable at [this link](https://nathancheshire.com).

I wrote this site using raw HTML and CSS with minimal javascript use over the weekend of 7/16/22.

Hopefully you can learn more about me and the skills I possess through this website as well as find something we have in common aside from a love for software/computers.
